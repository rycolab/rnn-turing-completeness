A teaching library for proving the Turing completeness of recurrent neural network language models. 
Implementaton programmed by Ryan Cotterell and Anej Svete.
The inspiration for the "proof by code" is Siegelmann and Sontag (1995) [https://binds.cs.umass.edu/papers/1995_Siegelmann_JComSysSci.pdf]. 

to start run:
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:rycolab/rnn-turing-completeness.git
$ cd rnn-turing-completeness
$ pip install -e .
```

to unit-test the code, run
```
pytest .
```
